# PostScript's SMD Tools
PostScript's SMD Tools (PS's SMD Tools) is an open-source, MIT licensed modding tool for Half-Life and other games that run under the GoldSRC engine (not Source).

PS's SMD Tools allows for the editing of GoldSRC SMD files in advanced ways that would be tedious to do by hand, such as copying bone transformations, allowing for 5-fingered rigs to be made easily out of multiplayer playermodels (e.g. HL Deathmatch, Counter-Strike and Sven Co-op).

## Features
- Armature Bone Transformation Duping
- Material Pointer Fixing (Fixing pointers to texture files)
- Scripting for extra automation

## Getting Started
### Running from binaries
If you are a Windows/Linux user, you can download binaries for your respective OS and run them without needing to install python. The binaries support the following versions of Windows and Linux

- Windows 8 and above (x86 only)
- Linux distros using kernel version 5.15 and above (also x86 only)

If your device doesn't meet the above requirements, you must run the program from the source code

### Running from source

### Scripting!
PS's SMD Tools has a fully functioning scripting system that allows the program to perform sophisticated functions using built-in functions of the program, for example creating sets of finger bones for multiple fingers using the Bone Duping function. Making scripts is quick and easy and there are many example scripts in the scripts folder to learn from!
