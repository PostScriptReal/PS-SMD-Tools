# PS's SMD Tools
This is a program I created that allows for manipulation of animation and model SMD files (Goldsrc only), allowing transformations of other bones to be copied and applied to another and allowing material pointers in model SMDs to be fixed.
## SMD Bone Duping
This function allows bone transformations to be duplicated and applied to another bone found in the armature (new bones cannot be created by the program), this can, for example, allow for easily creating bones for individual fingers instead of rigging 4 fingers to one set of finger bones.
## SMD Mat Fix
This function allows SMD Material pointers to be fixed by either being able to automatically add the '.bmp' extension to every mat (or one the user chooses) or replace specified parts of the pointer (such as removing '.001' from specified pointers).
## Scripting!
PS's SMD Tools have a fully functioning scripting system that allows the program to perform sophisticated functions using built-in functions of the program, for example creating sets of finger bones for multiple fingers using the Bone Duping function. Making scripts is quick and easy and there are many example scripts in the scripts folder to learn from!
